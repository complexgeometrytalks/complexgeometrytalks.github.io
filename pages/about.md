This Reading Group has been designed at the initiative of physicists, geometers and machine learners. We aim at better understanding together the topic of Complex Geometry, and sharing our knowledge to a wider audience. 
It will consist of featured talks provided by exponents on the field of complex geometry and related subjects, linked by a series of lectures aiming to provide a comprehensible background to the main aspects for the benefit of of the wider audience.

The Group will take place between mid-April and mid-June.
We hope that this innitiative will foster interactions between physics, mathematics and machine learning giving rise to exciting new ideas.
